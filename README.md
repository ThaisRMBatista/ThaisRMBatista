### Hey, I'm Thaís Batista! ✌

I work as an backend developer, and I'm officially starting this journey at the company where I'm currently, but I've been venturing out for some time now.
I live in Goiânia, Brazil.

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new.

### What I'm focusing on 👩 ➡ 💻

I'm currently looking to improve my skills in java and kotlin languages and learn more about the Android framework, using AndroidX, architecture components and Jetpack.

### Find me elsewhere
